This is the post for the 2nd day of advent of code 2021
this post will eventually be updated with code explaination
and some other stuff thank you I am very lazy

### What else should I put here
Some code explaination and on why C++ has been added to the 
roster of programming languages for advent of code

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "hello!" << endl;
}
```
